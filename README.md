This was the project that I worked on during the Insight Health Data Program at Boston in Spring 2017. 

In this project, I collaborated with iSono Health to build a deep learning model to classify benign and malignant breast ultrasound images.

Please check the blog post for more details.

Please look at the files with the following order:

- Image preprocessing and augmentation.ipynb
- Data pickling.ipynb
- Fully connected neural network.ipynb (optional)
- Convolutional neural network.ipynb

----------------------------

The model was implemented using python and TensorFlow on a Nvidia Tesla K80 GPU hosted by Amazon Web Services (AWS) EC2 p2.xlarge instance.

To set up the working environment, you may take a look at these helpful tutorials:

Also, you need to install python and Jupyter Notebook to run the programs.

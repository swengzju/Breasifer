## Background

Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer related deaths in women. It has been reported that one in eight women will be diagnosed with invasive breast cancer in their lifetime.

This project is a consulting project provided by iSono Health. The mission of iSono Health is developing a low-cost, automated ultrasound imaging platform to facilitate monthly self-monitoring for women to help with early breast cancer detection.

## Data overview 

There are 2,091 labeled 2D ultrasound images in total.

- Benign cases: 815
- Malignant cases: 1098
- Unusual cases: 178

## Image preprocessing

I applied a 3x3 median filter to remove the speckle noise on ultrasound images. I also resized all images to 300 x 300 by zero padding, for default convolutional neural networks training.

## Algorithms

#### Logistic regression

#### Random forest

#### Fully connected neural networks

#### Convolutional neural networks
